## Project Overview:
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analyzing FIFA World Cup data from the Wikipedia website. The primary focus is on creating a comprehensive report that includes key information such as the year, host country, champion, runner-up, final score, and the number of participating teams. The project aims to provide insightful visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the data.

## Project Steps:
### 1. Data Extraction:

Extract data from the relevant tables on the Wikipedia page: [FIFA World Cup Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) using Power BI import mode.
